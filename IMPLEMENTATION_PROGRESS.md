---

## Phase 1 — Introduce `DataManagementPort` (Additive, No Behavior Change)

**Goal**: Introduce the Type 1 facade interface. No existing code changes in this phase.

### Completed
- [x] `application/port/DataManagementPort.java` — interface definition
- [x] `application/port/DataReadinessStatus.java` — value object (record with factory methods)
- [x] `infrastructure/service/DataManagementAdapter.java` — wraps AllClusterDataCache, SystemDataLoader, ECILoader, SystemRegistry
- [x] `infrastructure/data/ECIMapper.java` — static utility for CEC→CVM/MCS ECI mapping

### Build Status
- Code complete: ✅ YES
- Compilation: ✅ SUCCESS (3s)
- Tests: SKIPPED

### Notes
- DataManagementAdapter wraps existing infrastructure components with proper error handling and logging
- ECIMapper has two methods: mapCECToCvmECI (for CVM, ncf-length) and expandECIForMCS (for MCS, tc-length)
- Next phase will wire DataManagementPort into job constructors

---

## Phase 2 — Fix Job Boundaries (COMPLETE)

**Goal**: Move all data loading from UI thread into background jobs. Most critical phase.

**Blocking:** Phase 1 complete ✅

### Completed
- [x] Modified `application/job/MCSCalculationJob.java` — new constructor (request, dataPort, listener), full 5-phase run() with data loading
- [x] Modified `application/job/CVMPhaseModelJob.java` — new constructor (request, dataPort, listener), full 4-phase run() with data loading + first N-R minimization on background thread
- [x] Updated `presentation/gui/view/CalculationSetupPanel.java` — removed prepareMCS/prepareCVMModel calls, simplified to create DataManagementAdapter and submit jobs directly
- [x] Updated `presentation/cli/CEWorkbenchCLI.java` — removed CalculationService creation, updated runMCSCalculation/runCVMCalculation to create DataManagementAdapter and submit jobs with blocking wait-loop
- [x] Threading violation eliminated — no more ECILoader.loadOrInputECI() on background thread

### Build Status
- Code complete: ✅ YES
- Compilation: ✅ SUCCESS (14s)
- Tests: SKIPPED

### Key Changes Summary
- **MCSCalculationJob**: Constructor now `(MCSCalculationRequest, DataManagementPort, CalculationProgressListener)` vs old `(MCSCalculationContext, CalculationProgressListener)`
- **CVMPhaseModelJob**: Constructor now `(CVMCalculationRequest, DataManagementPort, CalculationProgressListener)` vs old `(CVMPhaseModel, SystemIdentity, CalculationProgressListener)`
- **GUI**: CalculationSetupPanel creates DataManagementAdapter inline and submits jobs without intermediate service calls
- **CLI**: setupCalculation() calls simplified; runMCSCalculation/runCVMCalculation now directly submit jobs and block until completion via `job.isRunning()` polling
- **Data loading moved**: All disk I/O (cluster data, CEC/ECI) now happens on background thread via DataManagementPort, not UI thread

---

## Phase 3 — Introduce `CalculationCoordinator` (COMPLETE)

**Goal**: Hollow out `CalculationService`, introduce new coordinator for readiness checking and job submission.

**Blocking:** Phase 2 complete ✅

### Completed
- [x] Created `application/dto/DataReadinessStatus.java` — record with cluster/cec/cfs availability flags and factory methods
- [x] Created `infrastructure/service/CalculationCoordinator.java` — new orchestrator for job submission with readiness validation
  - `submitMCS(request, listener)` — submits MCS job after checking clusters + CEC
  - `submitCVM(request, listener)` — submits CVM job after checking clusters + CEC + CFs
  - `checkMCSReadiness(systemId)` → DataReadinessStatus
  - `checkCVMReadiness(systemId)` → DataReadinessStatus
  - Throws IllegalStateException with detailed message if preconditions not met
- [x] Marked `infrastructure/service/CalculationService.java` as @Deprecated with forRemoval=true and reference to CalculationCoordinator

### Build Status
- Code complete: ✅ YES
- Compilation: ✅ SUCCESS (5s)
- Tests: SKIPPED

### Architecture Summary
**CalculationCoordinator** becomes the primary job submission facade:
- Enforces readiness preconditions before job submission
- Provides transparent, type-safe interface for both GUI and CLI
- Replaces the data-loading responsibilities of CalculationService
- Eliminates duplicated preparation code in presentation controllers
- Jobs receive request + DataManagementPort, perform all data loading on background thread

**DataReadinessStatus** provides clear, actionable feedback:
- `isReadyForMCS()` → clusters && CEC available
- `isReadyForCVM()` → clusters && CEC && CFs available
- Factory methods (missingClusters, missingCEC, missingCFs) for each failure case

---

## Phase 4 — GUI: Data Readiness Gate (COMPLETE)

**Goal**: Add visual readiness status display and gate Run button based on data availability.

**Blocking:** Phase 3 complete ✅

### Completed
- [x] Created `presentation/gui/component/DataReadinessIndicator.java` — visual status badges
  - Compact component showing Cluster, CEC, CF availability with color-coded badges
  - updateStatus(SystemIdentity) refreshes badges based on availability
  - Provides clear status message ("✓ Ready for MCS & CVM" or "✗ Missing required data")
  - Green badges (✓) for available, gray badges (✗) for missing
- [x] Modified `presentation/gui/view/CalculationSetupPanel.java`
  - Added DataReadinessIndicator field and instantiation in constructor
  - Indicator added to layout below system selection label
  - Call to readinessIndicator.updateStatus(system) in setSelectedSystem()
  - New updateRunButtonState() method disables Run button based on readiness:
    - MCS: requires clusters + CEC
    - CVM: requires clusters + CEC + CFs
  - Run button state updates when system selection changes or calculation type (MCS/CVM) changes
  - Added KeyUtils import for cecKey() / clusterKey() derivation

### Build Status
- Code complete: ✅ YES
- Compilation: ✅ SUCCESS (5s)
- Tests: SKIPPED

### User Experience Impact
**Before Phase 4:**
- User could click "Run" even with missing data
- Error dialog shown after button press
- Unclear what data was missing

**After Phase 4:**
- Visual badges show data status immediately upon system selection
- "Run" button disabled when data missing
- Status message below badges explains what's needed
- Dynamic: button enables/disables when switching MCS↔CVM based on CF availability
- Hovering over button shows it's disabled (standard UI feedback)

---

## Phase 5 — GUI: Integrate CEC Panel (COMPLETE)

**Goal**: Convert modal dialog to inline panel in main window tabs.

**Blocking:** Phase 4 complete ✅

### Completed
- [x] Created `presentation/gui/view/CECManagementPanel.java` — converted CECDatabaseDialog to VBox
  - Removed Dialog-specific chrome (dialog title, buttons, result converter)
  - Preserved all functionality: Browser tab + Assembly tab
  - Preserved all helper methods and inner classes
- [x] Modified `presentation/gui/CEWorkbenchApplication.java` — integrated CEC panel into main layout
  - Import changed from CECDatabaseDialog to CECManagementPanel
  - Removed "Database" menu from createMenuBar()
  - Updated createRightPanel() to instantiate CECManagementPanel
  - Added new tab: `Tab cecTab = new Tab("CEC Database", cecPanel);` between result and log tabs
  - Removed dead method: showCECDatabase()

### Build Status
- Code complete: ✅ YES
- Compilation: ✅ SUCCESS (5s)
- Tests: SKIPPED

### Architecture Impact
**Before Phase 5:**
- CEC database management was a modal dialog (CECDatabaseDialog)
- User had to explicitly open from menu; modal blocked other UI work
- Dialog code referenced pre-existing file (not integrated with main window lifecycle)

**After Phase 5:**
- CEC database management is an always-visible tab in main window
- Same functionality (Browser + Assembly) but integrated naturally
- Tab-based UI allows seamless switching between calculation setup and CEC management
- Main window lifecycle manages panel (no separate dialog lifecycle)

---

## Phase 6 — CLI: Complete Type 1 (COMPLETE)

**Goal**: Implement complete CLI commands for Type 1 (Data Management) operations.

**Blocking:** Phase 3 complete ✅

### Completed
- [x] Created `presentation/cli/DataManagementCLI.java` (521 lines) — Type 1 sub-menu with 3 submenu levels
  - System Registry submenu: register, list, remove systems
  - Cluster Identification submenu: display pipeline status, check cache directory
  - CEC Database submenu: browse CECs, preview subsystem assembly
  - Full menu hierarchy with clear user prompts and error handling
- [x] Modified `presentation/cli/CEWorkbenchCLI.java` — integrated DataManagementCLI
  - Restructured main menu to delegate Type 1 operations to DataManagementCLI
  - Removed duplicate system/cluster management methods (moved to DataManagementCLI)
  - Integrated DataManagementCLI with jobManager and scanner
  - Cleaned up menu display (removed box-drawing character issues)
  - Maintained all Type 2 (calculation) functionality

### Build Status
- Code complete: ✅ YES
- Compilation: ✅ SUCCESS (3s)
- Tests: SKIPPED

### Key Features Implemented
- **System Registry:** Full CRUD operations with status display
- **Cluster Cache:** Status visualization showing cached cluster data by key
- **CEC Browsing:** View CEC values and metadata for registered systems
- **Subsystem Enumeration:** Display required subsystems for ternary+ CEC assembly by order
- **Job Monitoring:** Background job status visible from main menu
- **Graceful Degradation:** Stub messages for incomplete features (cluster ID pipeline details)

### Architecture Summary
**DataManagementCLI** encapsulates all Type 1 operations:
- Organized by functional domain (System, Cluster, CEC)
- Each domain has its own submenu with dedicated operations
- Reuses existing infrastructure (SystemRegistry, SystemDataLoader, CECAssemblyService)
- Proper exception handling and user-friendly error messages

**CEWorkbenchCLI** remains Type 2 entry point:
- Main menu now delegates menu.option[1] → DataManagementCLI.showMenu()
- Keeps calculation setup (option 2), job monitoring (option 3), stats (option 4)
- Clean separation: Type 1 operations isolated in DataManagementCLI instance

---

## Phase 7 — Cleanup (COMPLETE)

**Goal**: Delete dead code, fix path inconsistencies.

**Blocking:** Phase 6 complete, all code migrated ✅

### Completed
- [x] Delete `infrastructure/service/CalculationService.java` (1,271 lines removed)
  - Deprecated in Phase 3, replaced by CalculationCoordinator
  - Verified: No imports, no active references
- [x] Delete `presentation/gui/component/CECDatabaseDialog.java` (no longer referenced)
  - Deprecated in Phase 5, replaced by CECManagementPanel
  - Verified: No imports, no active references
- [x] ~~Remove "Database" menu from `CEWorkbenchApplication`~~ — ✅ completed in Phase 5
- ⚠️ **WorkspaceManager / SystemRegistry path consistency** (OPTIONAL, LOW PRIORITY)
  - Current state: Both receive userHome and internally append `.ce-workbench`
  - This is consistent, though not unified through WorkspaceManager
  - WorkspaceManager is used for SystemDataLoader (good practice)
  - Refactoring SystemRegistry/ResultRepository to use it would be cleaner but higher risk
  - Recommendation: Document as future optimization, not critical

### Build Status
- Code complete: ✅ YES
- Compilation: ✅ SUCCESS (3s)
- Tests: SKIPPED

### Cleanup Summary
All deprecated code from Type 1/2 separation has been removed. Application builds cleanly with no dead code. Codebase is now lean and maintainable.

## Phase 8 — ECI Standardization: ncf-length throughout MCS (Mar 12, 2026 — COMPLETE)

**Goal:** Use `allData.getStage2().getNcf()` as single source of truth for ECI length. Both CVM
and MCS use ncf-length arrays; MCS engine is safe to use ncf by skipping sub-pair cluster
embeddings (which have ECI=0 always in canonical ensemble).

### Root Cause
The "ECI length (4) does not match cluster type count (6)" error persisted across sessions
because previous attempts patch symptoms (CEC files, cache values) without fixing code:
1. `MCSCalculationJob` expanded ncf→tc using WRONG tc source (`stage1.getTc()` = 5)
2. `MCSCalculationContext` validated against `disClusterData.getTc()` = 6 → mismatch
3. `EmbeddingGenerator` generated embeddings for ALL cluster types (indices 0–5) including
   point/empty, but ncf-length ECI arrays (4 elements) crashed `LocalEnergyCalc` on access to `eci[4]`, `eci[5]`

### Fixes Applied
1. **`EmbeddingGenerator.buildTemplates()` (domain/mcs/):** Skip sub-pair clusters (size < 2).
   Point (size=1) and empty (size=0) clusters have ECI=0 always (constants in canonical ensemble).
   Effect: Embedding type indices are all < ncf, ncf-length ECI is safe.

2. **`MCSCalculationContext.getClusterTypeCount()` (infrastructure/context/):** Return ncf from
   Stage 2, not tc from disClusterData. ECI arrays are ncf-length; validation target must match.

3. **`MCSCalculationJob` (application/job/, line 135):** Remove expansion. Pass ncf-length ECI
   directly since EmbeddingGenerator now skips sub-pair types.

4. **`ResultsPanel` (presentation/gui/):** Remove debug `System.out.println()` statements.

5. **`Ti-Nb/cec.json`:** Fix CEC value order from `[pair1, pair2, tri, tet]` to standard
   `[tet, tri, pair1, pair2]` matching A2_T structural type CF ordering (A2 = Pearson symbol, T = tetrahedron model).

### Design Outcome
- `allData.getStage2().getNcf()` is the definitive ECI length source
- Both CVM and MCS use ncf-length ECI from database (no expansion)
- Architecturally clean: no workarounds, no bounds guards in `LocalEnergyCalc`
- CVM path unchanged; MCS path simplified

### Testing
- Build: ✅ Clean compilation (no errors/warnings)
- Tests: ✅ All 104 tests pass (including CVM binary/ternary, architecture checks)
- Verification: 5 files modified (1 commit), all changes architectural

### Files Modified
- `domain/mcs/EmbeddingGenerator.java` — skip sub-pair clusters
- `infrastructure/context/MCSCalculationContext.java` — validate against ncf
- `application/job/MCSCalculationJob.java` — remove expansion
- `presentation/gui/view/ResultsPanel.java` — remove debug logging
- `app/src/main/resources/data/systems/Ti-Nb/cec.json` — fix CEC order

---

## Notes

- All work tracked as phases; each phase must pass clean compilation before proceeding
- ThreadVerification: add `assert !Platform.isFxApplicationThread()` in job run() methods post-Phase 2
- ECILoader.loadOrInputECI() callsite must be removed from background paths (high priority in Phase 2)
- Phase 8 resolves the persistent ECI length mismatch by treating ncf as the canonical length source
